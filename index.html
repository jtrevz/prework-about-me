      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>
        I'm a real estate agent. I went to St. Edward's University where I
        majored in Psychology. I got into coding last spring once the pandemic
        started. I started with JavaScript but I'm excited to be fully dedicated
        to learning for this bootcamp.

      <p>
        I started learning to code during the pandemic. I felt a natural pull
        and had a lot of fun doing it. I really like how creative you can get
        with it. I also like understanding the basics behind what governs most
        of our life and having the power to manipulate it to help people, create
        programs, facilitate things.
